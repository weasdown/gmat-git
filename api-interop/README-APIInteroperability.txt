Beginning with GMAT R2020a, GMAT includes the files and code that 
enable native Python and MATLAB access to GMAT features.  This GMAT API
can be used to connect GMAT together with other systems.  This folder
and its subfolders provides documentation and sample code showing how to
connect GMAT to other systems through the API.

The gmat-monte folder contains examples that connect GMAT to JPL's Monte 
system.  Monte is driven from Python, so the examples in that folder are 
all written in Python and should be run using the custom mpython 
environment provided with Monte.  These files were all tested using 
Monte 140.1 and the Python 3 environment.
