Notes for ephemeris sharing

Comment in Cassini tutorial lesson 2:

	Monte can read SPICE files natively, but converting SPICE files to BOA ahead of time is usually preferable as it can speed up the processing of the files substantially. There is a UI command specifically made for this purpose that we can use, called Inp.spk.

Force model setup: See, e.g., lock/saturn.mpy
