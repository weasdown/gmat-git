Using Generics and Scripted Methods in GMAT Code
================================================

GMAT has the ability setup and (soon) use methods on its scripted objects.  The 
parameters set on object methods can be coded to be of a limited set of 
arbitrary types, simplifying the script interface while adding a bit of 
complexity to the code interfaces.  This document explains the programmatic 
interfaces into those features.
