After using Excel_to_RST_table.py to convert User_Interface_Spec.xlsx to csalt-UserInterface-smallTables.rst, the next step is to compile the rst into HTML and LaTeX.

Once the LaTeX file is generated, two changes must be made manually in order to successfully compile the LaTeX into a PDF. Both are in the User Interface Spec table, in the Trajectory.AddSimpleLinkageChain.Description cell.

There is text that looks similar to the text below. The lines should be made to look exactly like the lines below:

$\texttt{myTrajectory.AddSimpleLinkageChain} = \left\{\texttt{Phase1}, \texttt{Phase2}\right\}$

$\texttt{myTrajectory.AddSimpleLinkageChain} = \left\{\texttt{Phase3}, \texttt{Phase4}, \texttt{Phase5} \right\}$%
