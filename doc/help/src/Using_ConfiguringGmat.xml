  <title>Configuring GMAT</title>

  <para>Below we discuss the files and data that are distributed with GMAT and
  are required for GMAT execution. GMAT uses many types of data files,
  including planetary ephemeris files, Earth orientation data, leap second
  files, and gravity coefficient files. This section describes how these files
  are organized and the controls provided to customize them.</para>

  <section>
    <title xml:id="ConfiguringGmat_FileStructure">File Structure</title>

    <para>The default directory structure for GMAT is broken into 12 main
    subdirectories, as shown in <xref linkend="GmatRootDirectoryStructure"/>.
    These directories organize the files and data used to run GMAT, including
    binary libraries, data files, texture maps, and 3D models. Users are
    encouraged to review the README file located in the installation root
    directory. A summary of the contents of each subdirectory is provided in
    the sections below.</para>

    <section>
      <title><filename>api</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>api</filename> directory contains scripts that help
      the user configure and get started using the GMAT Application
      Programming Interface (API). The GMAT API allows the user to access GMAT
      functionality from other programming environments like Python and
      MATLAB. Sample scripts for both Python and MATLAB are provided in this
      folder. Follow the instructions in the
      <filename>API_README.txt</filename> file to get started with the GMAT
      API.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>bin</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>bin</filename> directory contains all binary files
      required for the core functionality of GMAT. These libraries include the
      executable file (<filename>GMAT.exe</filename> on Windows,
      <filename>GMAT.app</filename> on the Mac, and <filename>GMAT</filename>
      on Linux) and platform-specific support libraries. The
      <filename>bin</filename> directory also contains two text files:
      <filename>gmat_startup_file.txt</filename> and
      <filename>gmat.ini</filename>. The startup file is discussed in detail
      in a separate section below. The <filename>gmat.ini</filename> file is
      used to configure some GUI panels, set paths to external web links, and
      define GUI tooltip messages.</para>

      <note>
        <para>GMAT on macOS is provided as a notarized application. The
        <filename>GMAT</filename> folder must be installed either to the
        system-wide <filename>/Applications</filename> folder or to the user's
        <filename>~/Applications</filename> folder. The latter is useful for
        users without admin access to their Mac.</para>

      <para>The <filename>api</filename> directory contains a help file that
      GMAT will use to provide help in API interactive sessions.</para>

      <para>The <filename>atmosphere</filename> directory contains data files
      required for modeling of planetary atmospheres. In particular, default
      files for modeling Earth's atmosphere are stored in the atmosphere/earth
      folder. The Earth atmosphere files may be updated in this directory
      manually, or by using the
      <filename>utilities/python/GMATDataFileManager.py</filename> tool. It is
      also possible to point to alternate paths for these files in your GMAT
      script.</para>

      <para>The <filename>emtg</filename> folder contains files and scripts
      relevant to those using GMAT in combination with the Evolutionary
      Mission Trajectory Generator (EMTG) tool</para>

      <para>The <filename>graphics</filename> directory contains data files
      for GMAT’s visualization utilities, as well as application icons and

      and images loaded at run time, such as the GMAT logo and GUI
      icons.</para>

      <para>The <filename>gravity</filename> directory contains gravity
      coefficient files for each body with a default non-spherical gravity
      model. Within each directory, the coefficient files are named according
      to the model they represent, and use the extension
      <filename>.cof</filename>.</para>

      <para>The <filename>gui_config</filename> directory contains files for
      configuring some of the GUI dialog boxes for GMAT resources and
      commands. These files allow you to easily create a GUI panel for a
      user-provided plugin, and are also used by some of the built-in GUI
      panels.</para>

      <para>The <filename>hardware</filename> folder contains a single sample
      clock cone angle file.</para>

      <para>The <filename>icrf</filename> folder contains a data table

      <para>The <filename>IonosphereData</filename> directory contains files
      required for the Earth ionosphere model employed in the GMAT orbit
      determination tools. Two files in this directory require routine
      maintenance. The <filename>ap.dat</filename> file contains records of
      past and predicted Ap index observations. The ig_rz.dat file contains
      records of past and predicted solar flux observations. Those using the
      IRI ionosphere model for orbit determination should ensure that these
      files always contain sufficient data to cover processing spans. Both of
      these files can be updated manually or using the
      <filename>utilities/python/GMATDataFileManager.py</filename> tool. The
      remainder of the files in this directory should not be updated.</para>

      use of certain optimizers.</para>

      <para>The <filename>planetary_coeff</filename> directory contains the
      Earth orientation parameters (EOP) provided by the International Earth
      Rotation Service (IERS) and nutation coefficients for different nutation
      theories.</para>

      <para>The <filename>planetary_ephem</filename> directory contains
      planetary ephemeris data in both DE and SPK formats. The
      <filename>de</filename> directory contains the binary digital ephemeris
      DE405 files for the 8 planets, the Moon, and Pluto developed and
      distributed by JPL. The <filename>spk</filename> directory contains the

      Windows HTML Help file.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>extras</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>extras</filename> directory contains various extra
      convenience files that are helpful for working with GMAT but aren't part
      of the core codebase. The only file here so far is a syntax coloring
      file for the GMAT scripting language in the Notepad++ text
      editor.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>matlab</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>matlab</filename> directory contains M-files
      required for GMAT’s MATLAB interfaces, including the interface to the
      fmincon optimizer. All files in the <filename>matlab</filename>
      directory and its subdirectories must be included in your MATLAB path
      for the MATLAB interfaces to function properly.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>output</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>output</filename> directory is the default location
      for file output such as ephemeris files and report files. If no path
      information is provided for reports or ephemeris files created during a
      GMAT session, then those files will be written to the output
      folder.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>plugins</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>plugins</filename> directory contains optional
      plugins that are not required for use of GMAT. The
      <filename>proprietary</filename> directory is used for for third-party
      libraries that cannot be distributed freely and is an empty folder in
      the open source distribution.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>samples</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>samples</filename> directory contains sample
      missions and scripts, ranging from a Hohmann transfer to libration point
      station-keeping to Mars B-plane targeting. Example files begin with
      "Ex_" and files that correspond to GMAT tutorials begin with "Tut_".
      These files are intended to demonstrate GMAT’s capabilities and to
      provide you with a potential starting point for building common mission
      types for your application and flight regime. Samples with specific
      requirements are located in subdirectories such as
      <filename>NeedMatlab</filename> and
      <filename>NeedVF13ad</filename>.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>userfunctions</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>userfunctions</filename> directory contains MATLAB,
      Python, and GMAT functions that are included in the GMAT distribution.
      You can also store your own custom functions in the subdirectories named
      GMAT, Python, and MATLAB. GMAT includes those subdirectories in its
      search path to locate functions referenced in GMAT scripts and GMAT
      functions.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>userincludes</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>userincludes</filename> directory provides a
      location where GMAT will by default automatically search for code files
      imported into scripts using the <link
      linkend="IncludeMacro">#Include</link> macro. The user can change the
      search path for include files by modifying the GMAT_INCLUDE_PATH
      variable in the startup file, or by adding additional GMAT_INCLUDE_PATH
      assignments in the startup file. If multiple assignments are present,
      GMAT searches them in order of assignment to find any
      <guilabel>#Include</guilabel> files.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title><filename>utilities</filename></title>

      <para>The <filename>utilities</filename> directory contains some useful
      Python utilities. This directory includes the GMAT data file manager
      (GMATDataFileManager.py) which can be run to update many of the
      environmental data files (like space weather, EOP, and leap seconds
      files) that GMAT requires. There are also a group of utilities which are
      useful for analysing the output of Extended Kalman Filter runs, but
      these scripts require use of the GMAT MATLAB interface.</para>

    <title>Configuring Data Files</title>

    <para>GMAT uses many emprical data files that are periodically updated. In
    some cases files are updated by the owning organization as often as every
    three hours. GMAT is distributed with a python script
    <literal>\utilities\python\GMATDataFileManager.py</literal> that automates
    file updates, logs changes, and optionally archives old versions of data
    files used by GMAT. See the help documentation contained in the Python
    class for detailed usage instructions. Below we describe the empirical
    data files used by GMAT, and which startup file variables are used to
    define those files' locations on your system. The source of the data file
    and comments describe where the files are obtained and how they are
    used.</para>

      <title>Loading Custom Plugins</title>

      <para>Custom plugins are loaded by adding a line to the startup file
      (<filename>bin/gmat_startup_file.txt</filename>) specifying the name and
      location of the plugin file. In order for a plugin to work with GMAT,
      the plugin library must be placed in the folder referenced in the
      startup file. For all details, see the <xref linkend="StartupFile"/>
      reference.</para>

    <section>
      <title>User-defined Function Paths</title>

      <para>If you create custom MATLAB functions, you can provide the path to
      those files and GMAT will locate them at run time. The default startup
      file is configured so you can place MATLAB functions (with a
      <filename>.m</filename> extension) in the
      <filename>userfunctions/matlab</filename> directory. GMAT automatically
      searches that location at run time. You can change the location of the
      search path to your MATLAB functions by changing these lines in your
      startup file to reflect the location of your files with respect to the
      GMAT <filename>bin</filename> folder:</para>

      <programlisting>MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../userfunctions/matlab</programlisting>

      <para>If you wish to organize your custom functions in multiple folders,
      you can add multiple search paths to the startup file. For
      example,</para>

      <programlisting>MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/utils
MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/StateConversion 
MATLAB_FUNCTION_PATH = ../MyFunctions/TimeConversion</programlisting>

      <para>GMAT will search the paths in the order specified in the startup
      file and will use the first function with a matching name.</para>
